# Project-Habicht-cRPG
The IP2 Project of team Habicht.

The Project

The project wants to develop a game. The motivation for this was the various facets of development. Since the freedom of choice remained, it was for the group to decide on the challenge and personal interest in the subject matter. 
As a basis, CRPG was chosen as a genre, which is well suited for implementation in a project due to its characteristics. It focuses on dialogues and interaction with non-player characters. Scalability is also given. In this short time it is possible to implement a demo, which shows the most important elements and gives an impression.
